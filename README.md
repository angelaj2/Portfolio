This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data

# About Me
My name is Angela Johnson (she/her). I am a second year Master of Arts Management student. I am from Washington, DC originally, but went to college in western Massachusetts because I like the snow. I graduated in 2019 with an degree in Classics and a minor in Afro-American Studies, which led me to an interest in museum work. I am very interested in data and how it is used in the art world. I am particularly interested in how demographics data for museums is collected and used or not used to inform choices about exhibtions and events.  

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how to best utilize data to make better presentations and convey information. I want to be able to create effective graphs and other forms of visualized data and utilize it to the best of my ability to accomplish my goals.
