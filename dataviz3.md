I thought that this was an interesting data visualization because it contained a lot of information and came from a fascinating dataset. However, I thought this dataset could be better utilized to make a point or highlight interesting changes in the industry rather than just conveying basic information. 

This was my idea for how to change this data visualization. One of the things that I found most interesting was the increase in multi-racial actors over the years, especially compared to the US population.

I showed this graph to a couple of my friends to see what they thought. These were their responses:

Friend 1

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

A graph showing that there are more multi-racial actors working in 2019 than in 2014 and that they are proportionally higher than in the United States

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

It’s telling me that there are more multi-racial actors in 2019 than in 2014. And I guess at a basic level, it’s showing the amount of people in the United States versus the number of actors in a given year. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

Nothing confusing. I’m a little surprised by how many multi-racial actors there are. 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Nerds, first of all. Graph nerds and black people. Marginalized groups of any kind. 

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

The scales are slightly different and I would change that, but that’s all. 


Friend 2

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

A bar graph of what percent of the actor population is employed and what ethnicity they are.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

That there are more actors of colors in employment in the United States than in 2014

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

Not surprising. I was confused about the blue at first, but then I got it.


- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

 People who are interested in the breakdown of diversity in the entertainment industry.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Mostly just making sure its legible and make the graphs the same size and laid out side by side. 


With my friends help, I realized that this was a pretty decent visualization, but I wanted to make sure that everything was really clear. My second friend had a little bit of trouble with the graph at first. She understood everything, but it took more time than I would have liked. 

For my final visualization, I struggled with bringing my sketches to life, so to speak. I could not find a good way to show everything that I wanted using Flourish or Tableau and it was very difficult to highlight one specific column of the graph. I ended up not showing the US racial population percentages because it was not strictly necessary for the story that I was trying to tell and it was the best way to ensure that I was conveying what I wanted to. This was my result.
