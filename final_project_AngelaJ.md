# Outline
In this project, I am hoping to show how while sitcoms in general are becoming more diverse, sitcoms that star and feature primarily black leads have actually been decreasing over time.
For my story structure, I am hoping to begin with listing several of the most famous black sitcoms from the 90s and talking about how these were some of the most iconic television shows of the era. Although the 90s were a time when tv was famously segregated into "black shows" and "white shows", 15 of the top 20 shows for black audiences were also among white audiences' top 20 as well. 
I will next move to a data visualization of the top sitcoms in 1990 to 1995, 2000, 2005, and so on. I most likely do this using a stacked bar chart, so that I can show the number of these shows which featured a black lead. I think it will fascinate and surprise audiences to see this number going down over the years. 
Next, I would like to discuss the Emmy awards using a data visualization. This will most likely not surprise audiences to see how few black shows and black actors have won awards over the years. This number has actually risen, but it is important to examine which roles are winning awards, specifically the prevalence of supporting actor, rather than lead, roles for black people. 
Finally, I would like to give the audience some hope by examining general demographics of sitcoms, showing how they are greatly increasing in diversity as a whole, but simply need more work in providing lead roles for black actors. This is becoming more common in other genres, such as drama and prestige comedy, thanks to creators such as Shonda Rhimes, Ava DuVernay, Issa Rae, and Donald Glover, but for sitcoms, a genre that was once rich in black roles and images, there is a serious lacking.

# The Data
I will be compiling my data from several sources, including Nielsen, file:///C:/Users/angel/AppData/Local/Temp/FINALInclusionAnalyticsReport_Dec_2020__2_.pdf, for current trends in television diversity. 
I will also be using several articles from NPR, the Baltimore Sun, CBS News, and the Chicago Tribune.

In addition, I will be working from websites including the Emmy Awards website and tvratingsguide.com.

I plan to use this data in the form of bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs with the intention of showing how black-led sitcoms have decreased over the years, despite an overall increase in diversity.

# Method and Medium
I plan to execute my final project using Shorthand. This will allow me to display and explain my data with the purpose of telling this story. Using Shorthand, as opposed to Power Point or some other medium, will allow me to cohesively display my data visualizatins in a way that will be pleasing and engaging to audiences, while allowing me to scroll quickly through my points in the allotted time.
