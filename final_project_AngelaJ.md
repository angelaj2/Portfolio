# Outline
In this project, I am hoping to show how while sitcoms in general are becoming more diverse, sitcoms that star and feature primarily black leads have actually been decreasing over time.
For my story structure, I am hoping to begin with listing several of the most famous black sitcoms from the 90s and talking about how these were some of the most iconic television shows of the era. Although the 90s were a time when tv was famously segregated into "black shows" and "white shows", 15 of the top 20 shows for black audiences were also among white audiences' top 20 as well. 
I will next move to a data visualization of the top sitcoms in 1990 to 1995, 2000, 2005, and so on. I most likely do this using a stacked bar chart, so that I can show the number of these shows which featured a black lead. I think it will fascinate and surprise audiences to see this number going down over the years. 
Next, I would like to discuss the Emmy awards using a data visualization. This will most likely not surprise audiences to see how few black shows and black actors have won awards over the years. This number has actually risen, but it is important to examine which roles are winning awards, specifically the prevalence of supporting actor, rather than lead, roles for black people. 
Finally, I would like to give the audience some hope by examining general demographics of sitcoms, showing how they are greatly increasing in diversity as a whole, but simply need more work in providing lead roles for black actors. This is becoming more common in other genres, such as drama and prestige comedy, thanks to creators such as Shonda Rhimes, Ava DuVernay, Issa Rae, and Donald Glover, but for sitcoms, a genre that was once rich in black roles and images, there is a serious lacking.

# The Data
I will be compiling my data from several sources, including Nielsen, file:///C:/Users/angel/AppData/Local/Temp/FINALInclusionAnalyticsReport_Dec_2020__2_.pdf, for current trends in television diversity. 
I will also be using several articles from NPR, the Baltimore Sun, CBS News, and the Chicago Tribune.

I plan to use this data in the form of bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs with the intention of showing how black-led sitcoms have decreased over the years, despite an overall increase in diversity. According to nielsen, black actors make up 24% of broadcast television. However, it must be examined what roles these actors are playing. Although this diversity 

# Method and Medium
I plan to execute my final project using Shorthand. This will allow me to display and explain my data with the purpose of telling this story. Using Shorthand, as opposed to Power Point or some other medium, will allow me to cohesively display my data visualizatins in a way that will be pleasing and engaging to audiences, while allowing me to scroll quickly through my points in the allotted time. 


# Part II

# Storyboard and Feedback

For my project, I am examining how the landscape of television is changing and who we are leaving behind. Although television as a whole is becoming more diverse, nielsen shows that black actors make up 24.7% of broadcast television. However, it is important to examine what roles these actors are playing. This graph shows how the number of black leads has, if anything, gone down since 1990. 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7451347"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The 90s were a real turning point for black sitcoms. This graph shows how the early 90s were a bastion of black sitcoms in comparison to only 10 years later. 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7447668"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Although there were black sitcoms at this time, this was not at all recognized in award shows. Only one black woman has ever won an emmy for outstanding actress in a comedy series. That was Isabel Sanford in 1981. Only one sitcom centering on black people has ever won best series. That was the Cosby Show in 1985. Things need to change. 

This drop in the prevalence of black leads in sitcoms is for a variety of reasons. For one, television in the 80s and 90s were incredibly segregated. There were black shows and there were white shows. However, these black shows were very popular at their peak. 15 of the top 20 black shows from 1985-96 were also among the to 20 for white audiences. 

However, the other reason is a general decline in the popularity of sitcoms.
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7447734"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
This graph shows how the percentage of the top 20 shows over the years that have been sitcoms has gone down significantly. This is due to other kinds of media expanding, as well as fewer people watching broadcast television.

My call to action is pretty simple. Be more aware of what you're watching. Don't settle for more diversity in general. Make sure that there are a diversity of stories being told. Support black art and black artists. Do research and find out who is behind the camera. We have more power than we realize. We can control which shows are popular and which are successful. So be aware. Take action. 


I asked three people a series of questions about my graphs. These are the results.

## Person 1
Pie Chart visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

It looks like it’s trying to tell me that sitcoms are going away over the last thirty years.

- What is the message of this graph?

People have other interests besides sitcoms. Having lived through other sitcoms, it seems like the graph is saying that people are interested in other content.

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

People of my generation (50s, 60s), who lived through the sitcom era, rather than your generation, who has experienced very different types of media. I think the target audience is my generation, but your generation can look back and realize what it was like. But I think the message is the same either way. 

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

The only thing that confused me was the last graph because there was no green. It also made me want donuts. The years being so high above the image at first made it difficult to understand what I was looking at.

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

Well, it depends. If your goal is to describe the growth/waning of a genre in media, if your desire is to communicate in greater detail, maybe there would be a better way. However, if you’re just trying to state facts, this works well. I would like more details, maybe going into the why of it all. 




Line graph visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

It looks like, (it’s hard to see the numbers), wow, only ten years, the number of black leads plummeted quite a bit in that time frame. Now, it doesn’t look like the numbers were huge anyway, but it’s obviously a steep decline. 

- What is the message of this graph?

That have never really been a lot of black leads and, in this time frame, at least, that number appears to have dropped to zero. 

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?
- 
I don’t know. I have no idea. I mean, why would you even make a graph showing this? I would say something like students of African American studies who are interested in media from this period. I don’t think a lot of people would be interested because there obviously were not a lot of black leads at this time.

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

Nope, pretty straightforward

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

No, I think this story is pretty much said. 


Bar Chart visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?
- 
Well, could kind of say the pendulum swing, although it’s not that radical, it did kind of swing. 

- What is the message of this graph?

Really that not much has changed, at least there’s a little bit more color, but really not much has changed.

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

I don’t know. Again, perhaps someone who is studying media.

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

Yeah, it puts the south African on top and then it puts everything else. The way the colors are laid out have nothing to do with the percentage.

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

Yeah, you could put them in the right order (joking)
No, I don’t know, this particular graph bothers me, but I’m not sure why. 




## Person 2

Pie Chart visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

The percentage of top twenty shows that are sitcoms from 1990 to 2020 and how they have gone down. 

-What is the message of this graph?

That sitcoms have decrease in the last 30 years. They’re basically nonexistent now.

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

I don’t know. People in their 20s and 30s. I think old people care more that sitcoms don’t exist, but why would they be looking at graphs. 

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?
Not really no. I just didn’t really like the wording of the title. I also don’t like the Christmas colors. 

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?
Yeah, I don’t like this layout. I think it would be cool to show the title pages and how they have gone down. Also you could show the actual number instead of the percentage. But it would be cool to see what the sitcoms were.




Line Graph visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

It’s showing the number of black leads in the top twenty sitcoms from 1990 to 1999 and how it’s changed over time. 

- What is the message of this graph?

That it’s gone down pretty much, but it’s fluctuated, so it’s not consistent. 

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

I don’t know, the same people as before, 20s and 30s.

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

Nope

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

Yeah, you should use people symbols.



Bar Chart visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

It’s showing me the racial/nationality demographics for the leads of the top 20 sitcoms from 1990 to 2020 and how they’re basically all white.

- What is the message of this graph?

Just that most of the leads have been white over time and we’ve only recently gotten Asian leads, but black leads have gone down, but there’s kind been a resurgence.

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

Same people

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

The south African, why is he in his own category?

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

Probably. 


## Person 3

Bar Chart visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

Well, I guess it’s trying to tell me the race of the leads of the top 20 sitcoms from 1990 to 2020.

- What is the message of this graph?

I think partially it’s to show the homogenous nature of leads in sitcoms and how there were a surprising number of black leads in 1990 and then basically nothing for 20 years. 

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

I don’t know. People who are interested in tv. Also white people who are not aware of how often they are on shows. 

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

No...

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

This kind of bar graph confuses me, I’d probably go with a line chart or a bar graph. 


Pie chart visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

I think it’s trying to tell me about how sitcoms are diminishing.

- What is the message of this graph?

That sitcoms have been declining for the last thirty years. 

-Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

I don’t know. People who like graphs. Those who are interested in television history and modern trends in tv. 

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

Nope

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

No

Line chart visualization

- What does it seem like this graph is trying to tell you?

It’s trying to tell me that the number of black leads in sitcoms went down a lot during the 90s.

- What is the message of this graph?

Boy, there ain’t a lot black leads in 1995, but they decreased heavily throughout the 90s

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this graph?

I don’t know. TV nerds, black nerds, older people

- Is there anything about this graph that confuses you?

No

- Do you think there is a better way to tell this story?

No, I feel like you could extend the time of it, but generally, it’s a good visuzualization. 


This wireframing was very helpful. I did not realize that the stacked bar chart was a little confusing. It caused me to make these changes. They're small, but I think it makes a difference. 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7451347"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


It also caused me to change the color scheme of the pie chart.
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7447734"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I appreciated the suggestions for the line graph as well. For my final presentation, I will probably use people figures instead of the line graph, if, after more wireframing, I find that it is more effective. However, most of the people I asked liked the visualization and found it useful.
