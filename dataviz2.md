These charts show the general government debt of countries according to OECD data from 1995 to 2019.

This is another visualization of the data. Feel free to look through each country's debt-to-GDP ratio individually

Although similar, these three charts are telling different stories. The first is showing data from several different countries, but only for the year 2019. The second chart, for me, is an overload of information. It is difficult to discern any one thing because it is showing all of the data from all of the countries at once. I chose my third chart because it felt like a more accessible way to display the data. A person can walk through each country's yearly information and take what they will from it. Furthermore, they can select specific countries easily, as well as skip over ones that do not contain the information they are looking for. Color was not a very big factor for this visualization, so I just tried to pick one that was legible and not too distracting. Because we are discussing money, green made sense. Although both of my visualizations contain line graphs, they allow the readers absorb the data very differently and might allow for a greater diversity of audiences to comprehend.
